# School-Redesign
The purpose of this project is to completely re-design my high school's website, and introduce CMS(Content Managment System) to site administrators.

When the project is complete, my intent to give this website as a gift to my school. Since WordPress is available in many languages, I will be able to train site administrators on how to manage the content using their native language.
